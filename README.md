## Enumitem 3.6.1498

This package provides most of the flexibility you may want to customize
the three basic list environments (`enumerate`, `itemize` and
`description`) and to design your own lists, with a `<key>=<value>`
syntax.

### Latest changes

```
3.6  2018-11-30
   - New key 'left', for fast, tab-like positioning of the label.
   - The key 'widest' now works with 'itemize' and 'description'.
   - New key 'first', for code at the beginning of the list body.
   - \DrawEnumitemLabel, for visual debugging of the label position.
   - Extended settings for trivlist, with a new package option 
     'includedisplayed'.
   - Size dependent lengths (first steps).
   - Fix - 'format'/'font' was not taken into account when computing 
     'widest'.
